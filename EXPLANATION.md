# Description

For this landing page, I used Next.js 13 to take advantage of its scalability, easy maintenance, and simple routing capabilities.

On the initial display, the user will be provided with a large input field with autofocus, allowing the user to perform a search immediately. Additionally, I intentionally designed it to be simple, without a search button. To perform a search, the user can simply press the enter key, which is in line with the typical user's keyboard habits.

For the list display, I show the image and main title of the anime list response from the API. To navigate to the respective page, the user can click anywhere on the anime entry.

For pagination, I chose a simple design to maintain the overall simple theme. It consists of only next and previous buttons, along with the text indicating the number of search results.

As for the detail page, I opted for a straightforward layout, featuring a large image and additional information that users commonly seek. I intentionally kept the search input on the detail page so that users can perform another search if desired. Additionally, there is a back button to return to the previous search results list, preserving the page location and search keyword.
